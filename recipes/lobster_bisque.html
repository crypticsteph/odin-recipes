    <p>It is light and luscious and doesnâ€™t spoil your appetite for the feast that follows. The silky and creamy yet light bisque is the star of the show, while small chunks of lobster play a supporting role. It has a rich lobster flavor and a velvety, sumptuous texture. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lobster Meat</li>
        <li>Lobster Stock</li>
        <li>White Wine</li>
        <li>Sherry</li>
        <li>Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>Vinegar</li>
        <li>Tarragon</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove lobster meat from the shells and refrigerate until needed.</li>
        <li>Add the onion, celery, carrot, garlic, peppercorns, fresh thyme, bay leaves and lobster/shrimp/crab sells to a large stock pot over medium heat. Press down to condense any space between the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Add water to cover, then bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat so the water is gently simmering and cook for 20-30 minutes</li>
        <li>Strain the stock and store it in mason jars or plastic quart containers. The yield will vary. Stock can be frozen for up to 6 months.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, carrots and garlic and season with salt and white pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the tarragon, tomato paste, paprika and cayenne pepper, stirring until the tomato paste is well combined. </li>
        <li>Stir in the flour then add the white wine and sherry. Increase the heat to medium-high and stir until the liquid is absorbed. </li>
        <li>Add the lobster stock, thyme and bay leaf. Season with salt and white pepper, then cover and simmer on low heat until the vegetables are very tender, about 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove the thyme sprig and bay leaf, then puree the soup until it's totally smooth. You can use an immersion blender or do it in a regular blender in batches. </li>
        
    </ol>
